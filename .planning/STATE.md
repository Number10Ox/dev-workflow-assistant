# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-24)

**Core value:** Deliverables parsed from a canonical feature spec drive all downstream work -- Linear tickets, GSD execution packets, PR descriptions, and drift checks flow from the registry, not from manual coordination.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Core Parsing

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (Core Parsing)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-24 - Completed Phase 2 (Templates and Scaffolding) — verified ✓

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 25%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 5
- Average duration: 4m 13s
- Total execution time: 0.35 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 - Bootstrap | 3 | 17m 30s | 5m 50s |
| 02 - Templates | 2 | 4m 36s | 2m 18s |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (7m 5s), 01-03 (6m 18s), 02-01 (2m 40s), 02-02 (1m 56s)
- Trend: Strong velocity improvement - Phase 2 averaging 2m 18s vs Phase 1's 5m 50s

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8-phase linear dependency chain derived from requirements. Each phase delivers one coherent capability.
- [Roadmap]: REQ-011 (schema versioning) grouped with Phase 1 installer since versioning must exist before any JSON files are created.
- [Roadmap]: REQ-010 (template validation) grouped with Phase 3 parsing since validation is a prerequisite gate for the parser.
- [01-01]: Use Commander.js options (--install) instead of subcommands for simpler API.
- [01-01]: Use CommonJS module system for compatibility with commander and fs-extra.
- [01-01]: Enforce schemaVersion in all JSON files via writeJsonWithSchema helper (supports REQ-011).
- [01-02]: Use DWA_TEST_HOME environment variable for test isolation instead of mocking.
- [01-02]: Use node:test built-in test runner instead of Jest for zero test dependencies.
- [01-02]: Create placeholder .gitkeep files for empty source directories to track in git.
- [01-03]: Use semver library for version comparison to properly handle semantic versioning.
- [01-03]: Create timestamped backups before upgrade with preserved file timestamps.
- [01-03]: Only remove dwa-* prefixed skill directories for uninstall safety.
- [01-03]: Use node:test built-in test runner (corrected from Jest by orchestrator for consistency).
- [02-01]: Use Handlebars for template rendering with placeholder leakage detection.
- [02-01]: Generate feature_id in FEAT-YYYY-NNN format with random 3-digit sequence.
- [02-01]: Check both .dwa/feature.json AND feature-spec.md for existing feature detection.
- [02-01]: Template path resolution uses package source (../../templates) not installed location for scaffolding.
- [02-02]: Claude Code skill uses 4-step process: check existing, get title, scaffold, confirm.
- [02-02]: [DWA_INSTALL_PATH] placeholder resolved by Claude at runtime to actual package location.
- [02-02]: Tests use temp directory isolation via fs.mkdtemp, no DWA_TEST_HOME needed for scaffold tests.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- ~~Phase 3: Feature Spec Template v2.0 exact schema (column names, YAML fields) must be defined before parser implementation.~~ **RESOLVED:** Template structure finalized in 02-01 with 7-column Deliverables Table and structured frontmatter.
- Phase 4: Idempotency edge cases (deliverable deletion, ID renumbering, splits) need design decisions during planning.
- Phase 5: Linear API rate limits, GraphQL mutations, externalId support, and MCP tool names need verification.
